Used a Lakeshore 440 3-Channel Guassmeter
Ramped up to power supply 100A and turned off coil in between x position changes, but not z
BZ was measured in kGuass, while [Bx] and [Bz] was measured in Gauss
Z axis whas pointing downwards, along the coil central axis
The starting temperature of the coil was around room temperature
The final temperature of the coil was around 45 deg C.

After test the probe reads: 
Bx = 2.52 G, By = -0.98 G, Bz = 11.13 G

14:13 zero probe each axis 
14:15 placed the probe at teh same position
Bx = 2.401 G, By = -0.6838 G, Bz = 11.0915 G

unmagnetized Thor. Lau. Foil transfered and labelled with a single peice of masking tape (yellow).
Pol1 foil was labled with masking tape and green tape
2:40 pm ramping on magnet, temp is 30.5 deg C
Took under a minute 2:40 pm

Ramping down from 100 A at time 2:41 pm, started a stop watch
