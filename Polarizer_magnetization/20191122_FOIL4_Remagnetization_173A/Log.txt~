## Gradiometer meausrement of re-magnetized foil
The Thorson foil which we magnetized at 170A yesterday, FOIL4 =?
This shold have been the foil which was used in POL2 in 2018

### Observation/measurement 
Small scratch on the surface

### placement of the foil on the Acyrlic plate 
Diameter of teh AL frame + 36mm = Acyrlic plate length
Hole of the Al frame to lower edge of Acrylic plate = 20.5 mm

### Parallel scan
10:58 Tried to align the fluxgate at the center of the plate
the spacing between the Al frames and the Al rod: 11.8 mm on the right 
We may have an offset toward -x by 1-2 mm
Label 'DOWN' was facing +z direction (away from the experiemnter)

### Took out the foil in order to rotate it 
From the top of the fluxgate to the top of the Al frame: 42.5 mm
Fluxgate side length: 31.2 mm
From the Acrylic plat to the top of the Al frame: 5.5mm on the left(-x) side, 5.65mm on the right (+x) side
-> this implies a small elevetion angle 
Diameter of the Al frame 141.15 mm
Acyrlic plate thickness: 5.7 mm
Acyrlic plate side length: 7 inch bothes
Rotated the foil by 90-deg 
Placed the frame again so that the hole-lower edge of Acrylic = 20.5 mm
Centered the frame in reference to the acrylic plate 

Placed the Acrylic plate in the mu-metal cylinder: 25.4cm, 29cm
Looks centered!

### Transverse scan 
Orientation: the label 'DONW' was facing +x direction 
11:31 finished 
11:32 Estimated the elevation angle: 
    height of the Al frame from the acyrlic plate (-z edge) 5.65 mm
    height of the Al frame from the acyrlic plate (+z edge) 5.35 mm
11:34 Reassmbling the Acyrlic cover (the foil rotated back as before)

### Background scan 
11:45 done
