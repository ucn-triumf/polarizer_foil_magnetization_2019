1:31 We removed the foil now labelled FOIL2 from POL2 and are preparing to measure it
	-I noticed the screws holding the foil in place in POL2 are now manetized

The two x-axis of the acryilc plate are 
17.7 cm (positioned in the -z direction) and 17.7 cm (+z direction side). 

Aligning the magnetization direction in the -z direction to be consistent (it is marked with masking tape)
Centering the foil in the usual way. 

1:37 Taking measurments of the alinged axis

at some point we took transverse measurment with the masking tape make pointing along the +x direction

cycle 31 and 32 of the background measurement I wrote 12 and 12.5
This is a mistake. Should be 20 and 20.5

2:06 finished taking data for FOIL2 POL2 and a BG measurment

3:31 magentizd it with the florr deguassing coil, at 100 amps
[amps,min:sec]
(100,0)
(90,0:58)
(80,1:50)
(70,2:47)
(60,3:38)
(50,4:24)
(40,5:12)
(30,6:18)
(20,6:42)
(10,7:00)
(0,7:40)
Magnetized along -z direction. Hopefully see a more aligned magnetic filed measurment
FOIL2 POL@ transverse: cycle 2 I wrote 5.6 instead of 6.0

Magnetized POL1 - use background data from POL2 20191120 folder
4:21pm Finished measuring the foil magentization for the parallel case mZ=minus Z aligned
4:29pm Finished measuring the transverse direction
