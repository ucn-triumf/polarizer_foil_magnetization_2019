1:31 We removed the foil now labelled FOIL2 from POL2 and are preparing to measure it
	-I noticed the screws holding the foil in place in POL2 are now manetized

The two x-axis of the acryilc plate are 
17.7 cm (positioned in the -z direction) and 17.7 cm (+z direction side). 

Aligning the magnetization direction in the -z direction to be consistent (it is marked with masking tape)
Centering the foil in the usual way. 

1:37 Taking measurments of the alinged axis

at some point we took transverse measurment with the masking tape make pointing along the +x direction

cycle 31 and 32 of the background measurement I wrote 12 and 12.5
This is a mistake. Should be 20 and 20.5

2:06 finished taking data for FOIL2 POL2 and a BG measurment
