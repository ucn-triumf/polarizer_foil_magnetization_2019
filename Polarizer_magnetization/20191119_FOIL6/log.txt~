11:36 Measuring the background

SHR prepared a LEBOW foil, that had no applied current, labbeled FOIL6

48.8 mm from top of flux gate to top of acrylic plate
Top of foil holder to acrylic plate is 6.0 mm 

12:40 Measuring along the axis that we eventurally will magnetize to

12:50 Finished along -z axis, moving the marked axis to point aling the +x

12:55 Measuring the transverse direction of the LEBOW foil with no applied current in its history

I may have repeated the -7 measurement on cycle 6
cycle 12 is labelled 10.5 but is actually 10
1:04 pm finished measuring the components of the LEBOW FOIL6

Taking out the foil from Thor.Lau. from the foil holder. IT is labelled with a peice of masking tape. I am labelling this foil FOIL3

1:49 magnetized the foil along -z axis iwht 100A of current at ramp rate, 4.1 A/s. measuring parallel
2:09 finished measuring the axial and transverse magentization of the foil
