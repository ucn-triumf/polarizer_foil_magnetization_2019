11:36 Measuring the background

SHR prepared a LEBOW foil, that had no applied current, labbeled FOIL6

48.8 mm from top of flux gate to top of acrylic plate
Top of foil holder to acrylic plate is 6.0 mm 

12:40 Measuring along the axis that we eventurally will magnetize to

12:50 Finished along -z axis, moving the marked axis to point aling the +x

12:55 Measuring the transverse direction of the LEBOW foil with no applied current in its history

I may have repeated the -7 measurement on cycle 6
cycle 12 is labelled 10.5 but is actually 10
1:04 pm finished measuring the components of the LEBOW FOIL6

Taking out the foil from Thor.Lau. from the foil holder. IT is labelled with a peice of masking tape. I am labelling this foil FOIL3
1:49 magnetized the foil along -z axis iwht 100A of current at ramp rate, 4.12 s/A or 0.24 A/s. measuring parallel
(100A, 0), 
(90A, 49s),
(80A, 1min 33s), 
(70A, 2min 15s),
(60A, 2min 53s), 
(50A, 3min 26s),
(40A, 4min 4s), 
(30A, 4min 47s),
(20A, 5min 23s), 
(10A, 6min 02s),
(0A, 6min 52s)

2:09 finished measuring the axial and transverse magentization of the foil

4:14 magnetized in the opposite direction (+z) and finished measuring in the antiparallel positon
The ramp rate was 18.54 s/A or 0.054 A/s
(100A, 0), 
(90A, 3 min 12s),
(80A, 5min 48s), 
(70A, 9min 19s),
(60A, 12min 50s), 
(50A, 16min 12s),
(40A, 18min 59s), 
(30A, 22min 07s),
(20A, 25min 22s), 
(10A, 28min 42s),
(0A, 30min 54s)

4:17 Moved the marker to point along (+x) so that the magentization is negative what it was before

cycle two of the transvere- antioparallel aligned magnetic field should be 5.5
4:27 Finished
