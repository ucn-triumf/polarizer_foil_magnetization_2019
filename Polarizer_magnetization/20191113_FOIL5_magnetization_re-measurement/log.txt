Dimension Measurements:
The inner cylinder has a diameter of 20cm, the Outer cylinder has a diameter of 23 cm


20:00 The upper acrylic plate of the foil removed
The foil is placed with its magenetization axis anti-parellel to the movement axis 
The Al frame of the foil is 3mm thick 
The height difference between the foil and the fluxgate shuold still be 15mm

20:09 Measurement of the distance between rod and the profile frame (of +x) at upstream: 11.2 cm 
We scan with  fixed x: 0, and scan from -z to +z

20:28 moved the rod by delta x=+1.5cm
the offset from the +x frame is 9.7cm 
Cycle #35 is wrong

20:38 Moved the rod to offset 8.2 cm<-> x=3.0cm

20:45 moved the rod to +x offset of 12.2cm <-> x=-1.0cm
# data shold be corrected later 

20:54 moved the rod to +x. offset to the +z frame is 14.2cm <-> x=-3cm

21:05 removing the foil out to prepare for the reference measurement 
21:08 reference measurement at x=-3cm
21:13 reference measurement at x=-1cm
21:21 reference measurement at x=0cm
21:31 reference measurement at x=1.5cm
21:43 re-centering the probe before moving the foil upward 
21:51 loosened the band to lower the cylinder, checked by a level that it is leveled
      Measuring the new height difference between the probe and the foil
The acrylic plate is 17.8 cm width and 7mm thick
The height difference between the lower end of the probe housing and the top surface of the archlic holder of the foil is 
previously it was 1.7cm  

fluxgate thickness: 30 mm
sensor to the bottom of the housing: 15 mm
between the bottom of the housing to the archrlic plate: 17 mm (yesterday), 28mm (today)
Al frame is 3mm thick 
---> 15 + 17 - 3 = 29 mm (yesterday)
---> 15 + 28 - 3 = 40 mm (new height)
Effectively we raised the fluxgate by 11 mm. delta y = -1.1 cm

22:03 reference measurement at x=0cm
22:09 moving the probe toward +x, x=+2cm <-> 9.2cm of offset 
22:17 moving toward -x, x=-2cm <-> 11.2 cm offset 
22:30 placed the foil at the center, 29.2cm from each side 
22:36 moving the probe towrd +x, x=0cm <-> 11.2 cm
22:43 moving to x=+2cm <-> offset of 9.2 cm
22:49 finished the run, we store the foil in the frame
