Assembled POL2 with new Halbach Array early today
(Sean said: Tape was pointing down in the Halbach array)

Measuring background field
2019-11-21
1:40 cycle number 24 I measured 16.5 but was at 16

Distance from top of fluxgate to top of acrylic plate = 4.8 cm
Distance form top of fluxgate to top of foil holder = 4.3 cm

Aligning the foil in the usual procedure
make sure it is centered and pointing in the correct direction on the plate
center plate slowly
rotate inner sheild so that the foil surface is aligned with the fluxgates bottom

Piece of tape of FOIL4 is pointing in the -z direction to start

In transverse measurment cycle 7 labelled 7.8 instead of 8. Next cycle I repeated 8

3:18pm 
Put the FOIL4 inside POL2 with Halbach version 2 for approximately 30 min. It was in the aligned position

Now testing (-Z) alinged to see if there is any change

+X aligned cycle 6 wrote 7.8 instead of 8
cycle 11 I wrote 11.5 but should be 11
Finished
From just looking at the raw data, it looks like there was no magnetization or very little

17:00: Re-magnetized it with 173 A in the opposite direction
-> Tape was up while magnetized
-> Tape should point in -z and +x direction while measuring (Gradiometer)
